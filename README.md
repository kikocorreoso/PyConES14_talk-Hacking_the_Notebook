PyConES14_talk-Hacking__Notebook
=============================================

My talk at the PyConES 2014. How to convert the IPython notebook in your lethal weapon

The talk is composed of several notebooks where I will try to show you how to adapt the IPython notebook 
to your needs and workflow.

If you want to use this repo you will need to install Python, IPython and all their requirements. 
Some notebooks will need IPython version >=2 (actual stable version is 2.3.0) and others the development 
version (now it is 3,0,'dev'). In some notebooks there are some examples that use numpy, matplotlib. 
You can avoid or modify this examples if you don't want to install this libraries.
